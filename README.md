# tothebestof-remix

A tribute to the original [ToTheBestOf](https://github.com/andreskrey/tothebestof).

It follows a similar flow when you come across a new music band. First, it checks their top ten in [last.fm](https://last.fm), then searches for those songs on [Youtube](https://youtube.com).


### Why not another streaming service?

The original TTBO used Grooveshark, a long-dead music streaming service. In today's world, there are alternative streaming options with minimal costs.

[Spotify](http://www.spotify.com/) is one of those services, and it's big. Citing [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify): "As of June 2016, it has 100 million monthly active users, and as of March 2017, it has 50 million paying subscribers." As much as Spotify has to offer, it's library [doesn't cover all artists](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-abruptly-pulls-entire-catalog-from-spotify-20141103).
